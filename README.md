*Description*
Randy Beans likes writing down notes during the day so he can know what he needs to do.
Remember, he always ends his notes with DO NOT FORGET ABOUT THE BIRDS because he really does
care about his birds.  Can you look through these files and find something wierd going on?


*Hints*
1 - Think about the ciphers we have used and what you need to be able to use them.
2 - Some notes don't really look like they should be there.  Maybe look into those.
